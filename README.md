# TSX_EnhancedVehicle
This is a Mod for Farming Simulator 19. It adds differential locks and wheel drive modes to your vehicle. It shows more vehicle details on the HUD also.<br>

*(c) 2018-2019 by ZhooL. Be so kind to credit me when using this mod or the source code (or parts of it) somewhere.*

## default key bindings
* KeyPad 7 - enable/disable front axle differential lock
* KeyPad 8 - enable/disable back axle differential lock
* KeyPad 9 - switch wheel drive mode between 4WD (four wheel drive) or 2WD (two wheel drive)
* KeyPad / - reset mods HUD elements to its default position. use this if you messed up the config or changed the GUI scale
* KeyPad * - reload XML config from disk to show modifications immediately without restarting the complete game 

## what this mod does
* when the game starts, it changes all "motorized" and "controllable" vehicles on the map to default settings: wheel drive mode to "all-wheel (4WD)" and deactivation of both differentials
* on HUD it displays damage values in % for controlled vehicle and all its attachments
* on HUD it displays fuel fill level for Diesel and AdBlue and the current fuel usage rate<br>
**NOTE: in multiplayer games all clients, except the master, won't display fuel usage rate due to GIANTS Engine fail**
* on HUD it displays the current status of the differential locks and wheel drive mode
* on HUD it displays the current engine rpm and temperature<br>
**NOTE: in multiplayer games all clients, except the master, won't display engine temperature**
* on HUD it displays the current mass of the vehicle and the total mass of vehicle and all its attachments and loads<br>
**NOTE: in multiplayer games all clients, except the master, won't display mass correctly due to GIANTS Engine fail**
* key bindings can be changed in the game options menu
* if mod 'keyboardSteeringMogli' is detected some HUD elements are moved a bit to avoid overlap
* vehicles without AdBlue/DEF will produce more black'n'blue exhaust smoke

## what this mod doesn't do
* taking care of consoles. Buy a PC for proper gaming
* multi-language support (right now it's a mix of german and english)
